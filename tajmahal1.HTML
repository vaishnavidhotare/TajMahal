<center><h1>Taj Mahal</h1></center>
<p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna 
river in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, 
Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz 
Mahal. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)complex, which includes a 
mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a
crenellated wall.</p>
<p>Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued
on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The first ceremony held at the
mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the 12th anniversary
of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. The mausoleum was opened at that time to thousands of
mourners</p>

<p><b><u><h3><i>Architecture and design :</i></h3></p></b></u>
<p>The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Indo-Islamic and 
earlier Mughal architecture. Specific inspiration came from successful Timurid and 
Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal
dynasty, in Samarkand), Humayun's Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens and
hasht-behesht (architecture) plan of the site, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb (sometimes called
the Baby Taj), and Shah Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal
buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use of 
white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new
levels of refinement.</p>
<p>The tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. It is a large,
 white marble structure standing on a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical 
building with an iwan (an arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and finial. Like
 most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Indo-Islamic in origin</p>
<p>The base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an
 unequal eight-sided structure that is approximately 55 metres (180 ft) on each of the 
four long sides. Each side of the iwan is framed with a huge pishtaq or vaulted archway
 with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side. This motif of 
stacked pishtaqs is replicated on the chamfered corner areas, making the design 
completely symmetrical on all sides of the building. Four minarets frame the tomb, one 
at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners. The main chamber houses the
 false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan; the actual graves are at a lower level.

<center>Taj Mahal Minaret</center>
<p>The minarets, which are each more than 40 metres (130 ft) tall, display the 
designer's penchant for symmetry. They were designed as working minarets – a traditional
element of mosques, used by the muezzin to call the Islamic faithful to prayer. 
Each minaret is effectively divided into three equal parts by two working balconies that
ring the tower. At the top of the tower is a final balcony surmounted by a chattri tha
mirrors the design of those on the tomb. The chattris all share the same decorative
elements of a lotus design topped by a gilded finial. The minarets were constructed 
slightly outside of the plinth so that in the event of collapse, a typical occurrence 
with many tall constructions of the period, the material from the towers would tend to 
fall away from the tomb.</p>
<br>

<p><b><u><h3><i>Exterior Decorations :</p></b></h3></u></i>
<p>The exterior decorations of the Taj Mahal are among the finest in Mughal architecture. As the surface area changes, the decorations are refined proportionally. The decorative elements were created by applying paint, stucco, stone inlays or carvings. In line with the Islamic prohibition against the use of anthropomorphic forms, the decorative elements can be grouped into either calligraphy, abstract forms or vegetative motifs. Throughout the complex are passages from the Qur'an that comprise some of the decorative elements. Recent scholarship suggests that Amanat Khan chose the passages</p>
<p>Abstract forms are used throughout, especially in the plinth, minarets, gateway, mosque, jawab and, to a lesser extent, on the surfaces of the tomb. The domes and vaults of the sandstone buildings are worked with tracery of incised painting to create elaborate geometric forms. Herringbone inlays define the space between many of the adjoining elements. White inlays are used in sandstone buildings, and dark or black inlays on the white marbles. Mortared areas of the marble buildings have been stained or painted in a contrasting colour which creates a complex[citation needed] array of geometric patterns. Floors and walkways use contrasting tiles or blocks in tessellation patterns.</p><br>

<br>
<p><b><h3><i><u>Interior Decoration :</p></b></h3></i></u>
<p>The interior chamber of the Taj Mahal reaches far beyond traditional decorative elements. The inlay work is not pietra dura, but a lapidary of precious and semiprecious gemstones. The inner chamber is an octagon with the design allowing for entry from each face, although only the door facing the garden to the south is used. The interior walls are about 25 metres (82 ft) high and are topped by a "false" interior dome decorated with a sun motif. Eight pishtaq arches define the space at ground level and, as with the exterior, each lower pishtaq is crowned by a second pishtaq about midway up the wall.The four central upper arches form balconies or viewing areas, and each balcony's exterior window has an intricate screen or jali a grill lattice cut from marble. In addition to the light from the balcony screens, light enters through roof openings covered by chattris at the corners. The octagonal marble screen or jali bordering the cenotaphs is made from eight marble panels carved through with intricate pierce work. The remaining surfaces are inlaid in delicate detail with semi-precious stones forming twining vines, fruits and flowers. Each chamber wall is highly decorated with dado bas-relief, intricate lapidary inlay and refined calligraphy panels which reflect, in little detail, the design elements seen throughout the exterior of the complex</p>
<p>The pen box and writing tablet are traditional Mughal funerary icons decorating the caskets of men and women respectively. The Ninety Nine Names of God are calligraphic inscriptions on the sides of the actual tomb of Mumtaz Mahal. Other inscriptions inside the crypt include: O Noble, O Magnificent, O Majestic, O Unique, O Eternal, O Glorious... . The Tomb of Shah Jahan bears a calligraphic inscription that reads: He travelled from this world to the banquet-hall of Eternity on the night of the twenty-sixth of the month of Rajab, in the year 1076 </p>

<p><b><h3><i><u>Tourism :</p></b></h3></u></i>
The Taj Mahal attracts a large number of tourists. UNESCO documented more than 2 million visitors in 2001,which had increased to about 7–8 million in 2014.A three-tier pricing system is in place, with a significantly lower entrance fee for Indian citizens and more expensive ones for foreigners. As of 2022, the fee for Indian citizens was ?50, for citizens of SAARC and BIMSTEC countries, it was ?540 and for other foreign tourists, it was ?1,100. Most tourists visit in the cooler months of October, November and February. Polluting traffic is not allowed near the complex and tourists must either walk from parking areas or catch an electric bus. The Khawasspuras (northern courtyards) are currently being restored for use as a new visitor centre.In 2019, to address overtourism, the site instituted fines for visitors who stayed longer than three hours.</p>

<p>The small town to the south of the Taj, known as Taj Ganji or Mumtazabad, was initially constructed with caravanserais, bazaars and markets to serve the needs of visitors and workers.Lists of recommended travel destinations often feature the Taj Mahal, which also appears in several listings of seven wonders of the modern world, including the recently announced New Seven Wonders of the World, a recent poll with 100 million votes.</p>
